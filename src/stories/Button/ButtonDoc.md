This story showcases the "Button" component with five variants:

1. **Primary Button**: This button is styled as the primary action button.

2. **Secondary Button**: This button is styled as the secondary action button.

3. **Success Button**: This button is styled as the success action button.

4. **Warning Button**: This button is styled as the warning action button.

5. **Danger Button**: This button is styled as the danger action button.

Each button variant is demonstrated using the "Template" component, which takes props like "label" (Button labels must be no longer than 13 characters), "variant" (using constants from "ButtonVariants"), and an "onClick" function to define the button's behavior.

This story provides a visual representation of the "Button" component in primary, secondary, success, warning and danger variants, illustrating their usage and functionality.
