The Pin component is a user interface element designed for entering PINS in a numeric format. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation of its usage and their functionalities.

## Usage

The Pin component is typically utilized for PIN entry purposes in forms or authentication-related interfaces. Its versatility is enhanced by the following set of props:

#### 1. `length` (number)

* The length prop defines the length of the PIN input field.

#### 2. `label` (string, optional)

* The label prop specifies the label associated with the Pin component, providing contextual information about the purpose of the PIN input.

#### 3. `required` (boolean, optional)

* The required prop indicates whether the Pin input is mandatory, enforcing users to fill in the field before submitting a form.

#### 4. `value` (string)

* The value prop represents the current value of the Pin component, allowing control of the input's value from the parent component.

#### 5. `onChange` ((currentValue: string) => void)

* The onChange prop is a callback function triggered when the Pin input value changes. It provides the updated value as an argument to the callback function, allowing the parent component to handle changes in the Pin input value.
