The `Loading` component is a React component designed to display a loading indicator while data is being fetched or processed asynchronously. It provides a visual cue to users that an operation is in progress.

## Usage

**1. To use the Loading component, you need to add `LoadingProvider` in root of the application.**

```tsx
import { LoadingProvider } from "@bmesol/bmes-components";
```

```tsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement
);
root.render(
  <LoadingProvider>
    <App />
  </LoadingProvider>
);
```

**2. The `useLoading` hook returns a `loading` function that you can use to display a loader.**

```tsx
import { useLoading, Button, ButtonVariants } from "@bmesol/bmes-components";

const App = () => {
  const loading = useLoading();

  const fetchUserProfile = async () => {
    loading.show(); // Show loading indicator

    try {
      // Perform asynchronous operation
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    } finally {
      loading.hide(); // Hide loading indicator
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button
        label="Get User Profile"
        onClick={fetchUserProfile}
        variant={ButtonVariants.PRIMARY}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Notes:

- `loading.show()`: This function is used to make the loading indicator visible. It's called when you want to inform users that something is loading, like when a webpage is waiting for data to load or process.
- `loading.hide()`: Conversely, this function is used to hide the loading indicator. You call it when the loading process is complete, and you're ready to show the actual content to the user.
